    "Ans - Overfitting - Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing every data points in the data rather than the studying and understanding patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "1] Poor generalization - The model fails to generalize to new data, leading to inaccurate predictions in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "Ans - Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's cost function, which encourages simpler models. The goal of regularization is to reduce the model's complexity and variance, thereby improving its generalization performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevention of overfitting - \n",
    "\n",
    "1] Penalty on model complexity - Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that increases as the model complexity increases. This penalty discourages the model from fitting the noise in the training data and instead focuses on learning the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Balancing Bias and Variance - By penalizing large coefficients, regularization helps strike a balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting). It encourages the model to be simpler without sacrificing too much performance on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common regularization techniques -\n",
    "\n",
    "1] L1 Regularization (Lasso): The penalty term is the absolute value of the model's coefficients i.e. slope multiplied by a regularization parameter lambda. L1 regularization encourages sparsity in the model by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. It's useful when there are many irrelevant features in the dataset, as it automatically selects the most important features while setting others to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] L2 Regularization (Ridge): The penalty term is the square of the model's coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter lambda. L2 regularization penalizes large coefficients, resulting in smoother and more stable model parameters. It's effective for reducing the impact of multicollinearity in regression models and preventing large coefficient values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Elastic Net Regularization: It is the combination of L1 and L2, elastic Net combines the penalties of L1 and L2 regularization, allowing for a mix of feature selection and coefficient shrinkage. It's useful when dealing with datasets with high dimensionality and multicollinearity."
